# Stock Portfolio Performance Forecasting through Dynamic and Contrarian Investment Strategies in the Greek Stock Market

# ABSTRACT

The present dissertation aims to analyze the return of a portfolio in the Greek stock market, through the use of two investment strategies, dynamic and contradictory. The methodology of analysis and evaluation of the main goal is based on neural networks and artificial intelligence in combination with statistical analysis. In the first part of the dissertation, we use the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model that predicts stock prices through indices, based on their historical data. Subsequently, we create two portfolios consisting of 10 stocks, where the dynamic investment strategy is applied in the first one and the contrarian investment strategy in the second one. In the second part of the dissertation, we calculate the optimal portfolio for each investment strategy, through statistical analysis, using the Sharpe Ratio in combination of the Efficient Frontier. Both parts, are analyzed through the Python programming language.
Keywords: portfolio, efficient frontier, momentum, contrarian.
